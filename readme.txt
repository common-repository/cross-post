Cross Post plugin for WordPress MU. Allows a post to appear in multiple blogs.

== Description ==

  Cross-post is a WordPress MU plugin that allows posts from one blog to be displayed, or cross posted, to other blogs managed within the same instance of MU. The posts are not duplicated to achieve this.

== Installation ==

  Place the plugin in the WordPress plugins directory.
  Activate the plugin for all blogs that will be participating in cross posting.
  Read the documentation in the doc directory for configuration and useage info.

== Arbitrary section ==

  This plugin was developed to allow WordPress MU to satify cross sectional posting requirements in the "features" section of the Christian Science Monitor website. It has a couple items of "cruft" related to our internal requirements but they should not get in the way of a more general set of use-cases.
